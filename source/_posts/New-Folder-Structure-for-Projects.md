Over the past year I've been using a pretty basic folder structure for my projects. I had a main folder called Projects and within that folder I had each language separated as their own folder. For instance: JS, PHP, Ruby, Android, etc... and after a while, this got to be clunky and not what I desired anymore. I decided to go at it a much simpler route, which was separating what the projects actually are, instead of having to navigate through language folders to find what I needed.

After cleaning everything up I am now making use of the Developer folder in OSX, mainly because of the icon. Below is my current project structure:

```
Developer/
  archives/
  current/
  dev/
  playgrounds/
  sandbox/
  www/
```

- **archives**: for anything I no longer need, but want to keep in case I need to go back and reference any code I wrote.
- **current**: anything that I am currently working on as a main project.
- **dev**: anything I have checkout from source control or anything that's not a main project.
- **playgrounds**: XCode playgrouns live here
- **sandbox**: projects that I might be toying around with or random ideas.
- **www**: since I use MAMP Pro, this is my main directory for any projects that require MAMP.

With this new project folder It's easier to just go into whichever folder I know the project is in and get right to whatever I want to work on.

I hope this is helpful for anyone else looking to find a normal and unique project structure for their work, because we all know, after a while things start to get out of hand when there are so many project folders on our system.
